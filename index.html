    <p>Architects and designers work with geometry, but they do not build geometry. Geometry is abstract and cannot be
        realized in physical form. Even with the most precise digital tools, it is impossible to build a circle. What we
        are left with is a shape defined by the translation of geometric properties into material processes. These
        processes are embodied in the light transmitted to a LED screen, ink deposited on a paper or in the material
        extruded from the nozzle on a 3D printer. In most cases, architects make decisions about geometry to produce
        shapes which are then translated into material either by humans or computational processes. A contractor may
        produce a set of shop drawings to reconcile the forms and shapes present in an architectural drawing with the
        material processes of construction. Most 3d printers contain slicing software that translates mesh geometries
        into tool paths and extrusion rates. In both cases, the architectâ€™s work is distinct from the material
        processes. Another option, and one being increasingly explored in Robotic fabrication, is to directly link the
        design of an object to its material processes of construction. Computational tools are used to develop custom
        tool paths, mechanisms, sensors and workspaces that allow the designer to design not only objects but processes
        for the materialization of form. This semester we will explore the connection between computational design and
        material processes through a set of projects that examine the process of 3D printing. </p>
